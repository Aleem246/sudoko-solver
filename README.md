# Sudoku Solver

## Overview
This project is a **Sudoku Solver** with a **Backtracking Algorithm Visualizer**.
It provides an interactive web-based interface to solve Sudoku puzzles and visualize the backtracking approach used in solving them.

## Live Demo

## Features
- **Automatic Sudoku Grid Generation**: Users cannot manually enter numbers; instead, a random puzzle is generated.
- **Backtracking Algorithm Visualization**: Shows step-by-step solving using backtracking.
- **Speed Control**: Adjust the solving speed.
- **Get Puzzle**: Generates a random Sudoku puzzle.
- **Solve Puzzle**: Automatically solves the given puzzle.

## Sudoku Rules
- A standard Sudoku grid consists of **9Ã—9 cells**, divided into **9 smaller 3Ã—3 boxes**.
- Each row, column, and 3Ã—3 box must contain the numbers **1-9** without repetition.
- The puzzle starts with some pre-filled numbers, and the goal is to fill in the rest correctly.

## How the Backtracking Algorithm Works
- The solver iterates over empty cells and tries placing numbers **1-9**.
- It checks if the placement is valid according to Sudoku rules.
- If a conflict arises, it **backtracks** (removes the last placed number and tries the next possible number).
- This process continues recursively until the grid is completely and correctly filled.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML, CSS, JavaScript** for the frontend.
- **Backtracking Algorithm** for solving Sudoku.
